Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am contacting you on behalf of my client, Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates, who is facing challenges due to past political circumstances. In a bid to secure his assets, we have identified funds in a foreign security entity that he is unable to access. The amount in question is USD17.6M. We are seeking a reputable partner to assist in transferring these funds. If this opportunity interests you, please contact me via email for further details. Warm regards, Barrister Kola Owolabi(JP).
