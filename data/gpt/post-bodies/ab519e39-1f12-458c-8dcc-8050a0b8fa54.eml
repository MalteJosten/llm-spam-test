Dear Sir, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you regarding a confidential opportunity that requires your assistance. I am Dr. Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry of Mines and Power. Our department has come across an opportunity that involves transferring a significant sum of money to a foreign account. This transaction is highly confidential and requires your utmost discretion. The background is that certain contracts awarded by our committee were over-invoiced, resulting in an excess of US$11.5 million. The remaining funds need to be transferred to a secure offshore account, and we are seeking your help in this matter. Your role would involve acting as the beneficiary, and you will be compensated with 20% of the total amount. The rest will be divided among the members of our panel. We assure you that this transaction is legal and risk-free. If you are interested, please respond to this message at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration. Yours faithfully, Mr. Joe Mark.
