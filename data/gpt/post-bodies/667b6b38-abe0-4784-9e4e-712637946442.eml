Hello Dear,

I have a sensitive matter to discuss with you that involves a potential partnership for mutual benefit. I trust in your integrity and discretion in handling this matter. I am reaching out to you with respect and hope for a positive collaboration.

I am Bello Sankoh, the son of Mr. Foday Sankoh, who was recently detained by the ECOMAOG Peacekeeping Force in Sierra Leone. Before my father's arrest, he entrusted me with important documents regarding a substantial sum of money he deposited in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. This money, totaling USD$22 million, was generated from the sale of gold and diamonds and was intended for future family investments.

I am currently in Abidjan where I confirmed the existence of this deposit. I am also under political asylum as a refugee granted by the Government of Cote d'Ivoire.

My father instructed me to seek a trustworthy individual who can assist me in transferring this fund out of Cote d'Ivoire for investment purposes. I am seeking your help in this matter and require the following:

1) Can you provide a secure bank account in your country or a nearby location with favorable taxation for the fund transfer?
2) Would you be willing to help me obtain the necessary travel documents after the transfer so I can meet you for the investment?
3) Could you introduce me to viable business opportunities in your country where a portion of this fund could be invested without requiring significant technical expertise?

These requirements are essential for us to build a strong business relationship. I trust you as a fellow Christian to handle this matter with discretion and care.

In appreciation of your assistance, I am prepared to offer you a 12% commission on the total amount at the completion of this venture. Confidentiality is crucial to the success of this transaction.

I look forward to your prompt response.

You can reach me at 22507625348.

Thank you and may you be blessed,
Bello Sankoh
