Hello, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Victor Sankoh, and I am reaching out to seek your assistance in a matter that could benefit us both. I want to share a personal situation with you and hope for your cooperation and discretion. My father, Mr. Foday Sankoh, has encountered legal issues in Sierra Leone. Before his arrest, he entrusted me with documents related to a deposit he made in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. The deposit contains USD$22 million, proceeds from Gold and Diamond sales, intended for our family's future investments. As a political refugee in Cote d'Ivoire, I need help transferring this money to a secure account to avoid heavy taxation. Additionally, I seek guidance on investing a portion of these funds in a profitable venture that isn't overly complex. Your assistance is crucial, and in return, I am willing to offer you a 12% commission. Please treat this matter with confidentiality and let me know if you can help. Thank you for your consideration. Victor Sankoh
