Dear Sir or Madam, I am reaching out to you to discuss a potential opportunity of mutual benefit. A certain amount of funds, previously deposited by the late Head of State, needs to be transferred to an offshore location. This transaction is legitimate and does not involve illegal activities. If you are interested in participating, please provide your full name, address, telephone and fax numbers. This process will be handled with care and confidentiality. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated. For further details, you can contact me at 234-80-33055024 or via email at williamsfalana@caramail.com. Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}
