Dear President,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Helina Karimu, and I am an investor from Angola currently residing in Benin Republic due to the civil unrest in my homeland.

I am seeking opportunities for investment in a stable political environment with reliable infrastructure and a secure atmosphere for both life and property.

A contact recommended your company during their visit to Cotonou, suggesting that you might be able to assist me in realizing my investment goals. I have $30.5 million USD at my disposal, an inheritance from my late husband, earmarked for investments.

My intention is to invest in a company that shows promise for growth and stability, whether it be yours or another with potential. I am open to considering any profitable venture you may recommend, provided it aligns with my investment criteria.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could kindly respond with your personal and company profile. In return, I will share all the necessary details about myself and the specific assistance I require for my investment endeavors.

You can also reach me at helinakarimu@ecplaza.net and hk_hk@post.com.

I look forward to the possibility of forging a successful business relationship with you.

Best Regards,
Helina Karimu
Investor
