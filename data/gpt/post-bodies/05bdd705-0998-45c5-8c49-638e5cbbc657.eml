Bassey & Associates, located in Falomo, Ikoyi, Lagos, Nigeria, is reaching out to you with a proposal. I  represent Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo's estates. Alhaji Gwarzo served as the chief security advisor to the late General Sani Abacha of Nigeria. Due to political changes, Alhaji Gwarzo is currently confined to his village, facing challenges. The purpose of this message is to inform you of an opportunity. There are funds deposited overseas from security votes allocated during Alhaji Gwarzo's tenure. These funds were intended for purchasing equipment for the presidential security outfit but were never utilized. With all his assets seized by the current regime, Alhaji Gwarzo seeks a foreign partner to assist in transferring ownership of these funds. The total amount is USD33.6 million. If you are interested, please contact me via email for further details. Thank you. Barrister Williams Bassey (JP), Principal Partner at Bassey & Associates.
