Dear Potential Partner, I want to express my regrets for reaching out to you through this channel. As a member of the Nigerian government and a founding member of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), I oversee the Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC). The NDDC manages the disbursement of oil sales revenues, amounting to millions of dollars monthly. Currently, my colleagues and I require a trustworthy partner with a foreign bank account to facilitate the transfer of $49.5 million. This sum represents our commission from oil sales contracts. The funds are held in the Government Account CBN/FGN INDEPENDENT REVENUE at J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK, New York. To comply with regulations, we need to transfer the funds to a foreign account. I have been tasked with finding an overseas partner to receive this transfer. If you are interested, please respond to negotiate your compensation. Our partnership hinges on your transparency, discretion, and providing a bank account under your control. This transaction is legitimate, risk-free, and we have mechanisms in place to ensure a smooth transfer to your account within 10-14 working days once we agree and you provide the necessary details. I look forward to potentially collaborating with you. Kind regards, Anderson K. Eseimoku.
