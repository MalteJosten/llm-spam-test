Greetings, I am contacting you regarding a sensitive matter. My name is Steven Duba, and I acquired your contact information through a reputable source. I am currently facing challenges due to the unfortunate events that occurred in Zimbabwe involving my late father, Theo Duba. In the past, there were issues with land expropriation by the Zimbabwean government that impacted our family severely. My father took precautionary measures by transferring a sum of money, $15 million, out of the country for safekeeping in South Africa. Unfortunately, my father passed away, and I am now seeking assistance to relocate and access these funds for investment purposes. I am in a difficult situation as my only contact, the lawyer involved, is unavailable due to health reasons. Your help in facilitating the transfer of this fund to your country would be greatly appreciated. If you are willing to assist, please reach out to me at the provided contact number. Kindly treat this matter with utmost confidentiality. Thank you for considering my request. Sincerely, Steven Duba
