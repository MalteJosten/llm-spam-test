Hello, I am Barrister Williams Falana, a member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). I came across your contact information through the World Business Encyclopaedia and wanted to share a confidential opportunity with you. A substantial sum of money, USD48M, was deposited by the late Head of State, GEN.SANI ABACHA, into a security company in our country for safekeeping. This money was initially intended for his political campaign. As his family attorney, he entrusted me with the necessary documentation related to this deposit before his passing. We have made arrangements with an offshore security company to transfer this money as a consignment through diplomatic means to their offshore office. You will be required to claim the consignment as the legitimate beneficiary. This transaction is completely safe and risk-free, involving no illicit funds. In exchange for your assistance, you will receive 20% of the total amount, with 5% allocated for general expenses, and 75% for us. Please provide your full name, address, telephone, and fax numbers via email, so we can proceed with the necessary documentation and ownership transfer. Once you confirm your interest by sending the requested details, we can finalize this transaction within seven working days. Feel free to reach me at 234-80-33055024 or via email at williamsfalana@caramail.com. Looking forward to your prompt response. Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana {SAN}
