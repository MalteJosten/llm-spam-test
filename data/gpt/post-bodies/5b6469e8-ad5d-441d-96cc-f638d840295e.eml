Dear Sir, With all due respect and humility, I am reaching out to seek assistance for my children and myself. I obtained your contact details from my late husband's contacts and trust that you are a reliable individual who will handle this sensitive matter with care. I am a native of Konobo in the Kerema local district of Sierra Leone, West Africa. I am the widow of the late Dr. Mundi A. Kojo, who was tragically assassinated by rebel forces. Prior to his untimely death, he instructed me and our children, Ibrahim and Amina, to flee Sierra Leone to safety amidst a civil conflict. We managed to escape to Togo with valuable assets, including $25 million USD in cash, which is currently secured with a Trust Company in Togo. I am seeking your assistance to retrieve this fund from the Trust Company and transfer it to your country for investment purposes. Your support in facilitating this process and guiding us on wise investments in your country would be greatly appreciated. In return for your help, you will receive a 20% share of the total amount. Due to security concerns, I advise coordinating with my son, Ibrahim Kojo, via email at ibrahimkojo@caramail.com. Kindly provide your private fax and phone number for confidential communication. There are no risks involved in this legitimate business proposition. Thank you for your consideration. Best regards, Mrs. Anne Kojo.
