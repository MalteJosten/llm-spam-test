Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your assistance in a confidential matter involving the assets of the late General Sani Abacha. As the family lawyer, I have been entrusted with securing these assets due to the challenges faced by the family from past and present regimes. We have identified a sum of US$50 million that we have successfully relocated for safekeeping. If you are interested, we can designate you as the beneficiary of this fund, and upon finalization, you will receive 25% of the total amount. Rest assured, this process is low-risk given my involvement in the deceased General Abacha's affairs. This opportunity requires discretion, and I look forward to your prompt response. Thank you for your attention. Best regards, Barrister Adewale Coker.
