Hello, I am Dr. James Alabi, the chairman of a committee appointed by the Nigerian government to award and review contracts. I discovered your profile while searching for someone trustworthy to assist with a confidential financial transaction involving transferring a significant sum of money to a foreign account. There were contracts in the oil industry overvalued by US$12,320,000.00, and this excess amount is now available for transfer. My colleagues and I are unable to have foreign accounts due to regulations, so we seek your help in transferring the funds. In return, you will receive 20% of the transferred sum, with 10% set aside for expenses. The transfer can be completed in 7 working days. Your involvement is risk-free, and we will ensure that all procedures are conducted legally with your involvement. Your confidentiality is crucial, and we are eager to proceed promptly as we are time-constrained. Please respond to this email if you are interested, and we will provide further details. Thank you.
