Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Eduado de Mello, a former commander of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. The recent events in Angola, including the loss of my superior, have led me to reconsider my involvement in the conflict. I have taken a decision to step away from the armed struggle and seek a new life in South Africa temporarily. As part of my past responsibilities, I have access to $32 million, originally intended for the purchase of weapons, which is now available for other use. If you are willing to assist me in handling this sum, I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total amount. Please respond to edum@hkem.com, and I will facilitate the transfer of the funds. Your cooperation is appreciated in this matter.

Thank you,
Eduado de Mello
