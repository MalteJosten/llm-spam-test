Dear Sir, I am Barrister Williams Falana, a respected member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your details came to my attention through the World Business Encyclopaedia. Therefore, I would like to share a confidential opportunity with you for our mutual benefit. A significant amount of USD48M (Forty-eight Million United States Dollars) was entrusted to a security company in Nigeria by the late Head of State, General Sani Abacha, for safekeeping. This money is stored in secure vaults labeled as personal belongings, unbeknownst to the security company about its actual contents. Originally intended for political campaign funds, the late head of state shared the relevant documentation regarding this deposit with me before his passing. With all arrangements already in place, an offshore Security Company will facilitate the transfer of this sum as a consignment through diplomatic channels to their offshore affiliate office. You will then be required to claim the consignment as the rightful beneficiary. Please note that this transaction is secure and entirely risk-free, devoid of any illicit funds involvement. Should you be interested in proceeding, you will receive 20% of the total sum for your assistance, with 5% allocated for general expenses and the remaining 75% divided amongst us. To proceed, kindly provide me with your full name, address, telephone, and fax numbers via email. These details will be used to draft an agreement ensuring the smooth transition of ownership of the consignment to your name as the beneficiary. Upon receipt of your details and confirmation of your interest, the transaction can be finalized within seven working days. Your prompt response is appreciated. You can contact me via my Cell Telephone No: 234-80- 33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@caramail.com. Best regards, Barrister Williams Falana.
