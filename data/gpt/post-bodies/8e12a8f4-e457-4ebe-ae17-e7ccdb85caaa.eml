This document contains multiple parts.

In this document, we showcase Backup CDs, also referred to as Duplicate CDs. These Backup CDs are duplications of Software.

For instance, if you were to purchase Windows XP Pro from a store for around $299, you would receive the Serial Key, the CD, the Packaging, and the Manual. When acquiring it from us, you will only receive the Windows XP CD and the Serial Number for just $19.99. The functionality remains the same; the only difference is the absence of the manual and the colorful packaging, which are not particularly useful.
