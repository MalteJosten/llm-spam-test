Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding a business opportunity that requires confidentiality. The nature of this opportunity is sensitive, and I assure you that it is both legitimate and secure. We came across your contact information and believe you could assist us in a financial transaction that involves transferring a significant sum of money to an offshore account.  Our background lies in awarding contracts in the Ministry of Mines and Power. Due to regulations, we are unable to handle offshore accounts, hence the need for your involvement. Together, we aim to transfer a surplus of $11.5 million left from over-invoiced contracts. If you agree to collaborate, you will receive 20% of this amount, while the rest will be divided amongst us. I trust your integrity and discretion in handling this matter. The process is legal and devoid of risk. Please acknowledge this message, and I will provide further details. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your attention. Yours faithfully, Osaro Ame
