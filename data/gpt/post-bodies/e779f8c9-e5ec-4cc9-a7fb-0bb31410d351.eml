Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding a matter that requires confidentiality and trust.

My name is Adewale Coker, a legal representative, and I used to work with the family of the late General Sani Abacha, a former military ruler of Nigeria. Since the passing of General Abacha, his family has faced difficulties from subsequent governments. 
The family has managed to move a substantial amount of money, approximately US$50 million, out of the country to a secure location in North America.

We are looking for assistance in handling this matter discreetly. If you are interested, we can designate you as the beneficiary of a portion of the funds, and you would receive 25% of the total sum after clearance from the security company.

This is a legitimate and low-risk opportunity, and I am directly involved as a confidant of the Abacha family. Your participation in this project would be greatly appreciated, and we are open to further collaboration in the future.

I await your prompt response.

Thank you,
Adewale Coker
