Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am George Osawa, Chairman of the Contract Review Committee at the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). I am reaching out to you with a unique opportunity that could benefit both of us. We have identified an unclaimed contract entitlement worth Seventy-One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$71,500,000.00) held in an offshore account at the Central Bank of Nigeria. This sum (US$71.5M) was part of an over-invoice contract and is ready for disbursement to a recommended beneficiary. With your discreet assistance, we can facilitate the transfer of these funds. I propose a sharing arrangement as follows: 70% for our team, 20% for you as our partner, and 10% to cover any incidental expenses during the process. Due to restrictions, as civil servants, on holding foreign accounts, we seek your collaboration. If you are interested, please provide the beneficiary name and confidential contact details. Further discussions will outline the fund transfer process and the necessary details for this collaboration. Your prompt response is appreciated. Thank you for considering this opportunity. Best regards, George Osawa
