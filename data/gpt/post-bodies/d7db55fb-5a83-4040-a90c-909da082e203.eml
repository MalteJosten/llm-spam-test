Hello, It's been a while since we last met, as I was busy with my girlfriend. But now, that's over. Alex left me hanging. I'm sharing this with you to show you a different side of her. Out of frustration, I created my own website. Have a look: http://alexandra.hobby.privatseite.to What do you think? Best regards, Peter
