Dear Sir/Madam, I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, seeking your assistance in a financial matter. I have access to a sum of money that I wish to invest in your country. The funds originated from a business deal between my late husband and a Russian firm. Due to recent government scrutiny, I am unable to utilize the money locally and need help transferring it to a safe bank account. Your assistance will be compensated with a 20% commission. Please contact me for further discussion. Kindly treat this matter with confidentiality. Best regards, Mrs. Mariam Abacha.
