Hello,

I'm writing to you with a request that I hope you consider. I'm Mrs. Sese-seko and the widow of the late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In light of my current situation, I am reaching out to you for help.

After my husband's passing, my family and I escaped to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire, and later settled in Morocco due to challenging circumstances. We took precautions to safeguard my husband's wealth, which was being targeted by the new regime in the DRC. Currently, we are monitoring the political landscape to make informed decisions. Now that there have been changes in leadership, we are considering options to secure our assets.

I have arranged for a significant sum of money, $18,000,000, to be kept safe with a security company. I am seeking someone trustworthy who can help manage this fund discreetly. If you are interested, please let me know so I can connect you with my son, Kongolo, who will provide more details on how to proceed. Our goal is to invest wisely and protect our identity.

Your involvement in this matter requires utmost confidentiality and trust. If you are willing to assist, my son will share all necessary information with you, including the current location of the funds and appropriate compensation for your support.

To move forward, kindly share your contact details, including your personal phone number and fax, and confirm receipt of this message.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.
