Dear Potential Partner, I hope this message finds you well. I would like to extend my apologies for resorting to email for this correspondence. I serve as a respected official in the Government of Nigeria and a founding member of the ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). I oversee the Niger Delta Development Corporation (NDDC), responsible for managing oil sales revenues for the government. We have access to significant funds, and my colleagues and I seek a trustworthy foreign partner to assist us in transferring $49.5 million. This sum represents commissions from oil sales contracts we supervised. The funds are currently held in a designated government account with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, New York. I have been tasked with finding an overseas entity to facilitate this transfer. By partnering with us, your company will be presented as a registered foreign entity with operations in Nigeria. Your contribution will be framed as payment for services rendered to our country through government agencies like the NDDC. In exchange for your cooperation, we can discuss a mutually beneficial fee or percentage upon receipt of the funds. It is imperative that this venture is handled with the utmost discretion and confidentiality. We require assurance of your transparency and a reliable bank account under your control. This transaction, while discreet, is legitimate and devoid of risks or legal repercussions. We have taken precautions to ensure a seamless transfer to your account within 10-14 working days post-agreement. I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you and request your discretion throughout our engagement. Please respond to initiate discussions. Sincerely, Anderson K. Eseimoku
