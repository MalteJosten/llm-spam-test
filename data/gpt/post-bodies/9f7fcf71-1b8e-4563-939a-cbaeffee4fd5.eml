Hello,

You may have come across the 'The Letter' $5.00 Paypal Program recently featured on reputable media outlets like 20/20 and OPRAH WINFREY. How would you like to explore a new income opportunity that requires minimal setup time? Even if you are already involved in another program, you can diversify your income streams by trying this one as well. There is no cap on the earnings you can generate from this venture.

The process is straightforward. If you are looking to make a substantial amount of money quickly, the program I am about to introduce is the solution. It is an incredibly fast and simple program that can be completed in just an hour!

Here is something that might interest you. Please read through this information. This is not something I would typically consider, but after reading an article in the Wall Street Journal on 6/16/2001 about PayPal and coming across this concept, I was confident it would be effective, given my positive experience with PayPal's services. This entire process can be completed in an hour, and it will be a decision you will not regret. And did I mention it's fast? By fast, I mean as fast as the internet - quick and efficient, entirely conducted via email.

If you require verification, here are two testimonials from individuals who invested only a fraction of their time and saw remarkable results:

Testimonials from:

Tony Stevens, Vandenberg AFB, CA:
Thank you for sharing this opportunity! I shared it with all our frat brothers, and although I haven't reached $20,000 yet, I have earned $8,285. Be sure to include me in the next round!

Mary Gathers, Columbia, SC:
Hello, It's Mary. I have only one thing to say - unbelievable! I sent out 20 emails as instructed and went on a vacation. Upon my return, I found my account with over $12,000. Thank you!

Getting Started:
If you are not already a PayPal user, the first step is to sign up for a PayPal account, which takes just two minutes, and PayPal will credit your account with $5. This makes this program free for you.

Here's the link:

Ensure to sign up for a free Premier account to avoid the $100 limit; otherwise, you will only be able to make up to $100. You can earn considerably more through this program!

Next, transfer $5 from your PayPal account (including the free $5) to the first name on the list (No.1) along with a friendly note like 'Please add me to your mailing list.' Get ready to be excited – it will not disappoint you.

While waiting for responses from others, give this a try. It only requires an hour of your time to kick off - no mailing lists, no printing, no waiting, and it is entirely legal (complies with US Postal and Lottery Laws).

The working mechanism is simple, unlike many other programs. This three-tier program is practical and notably faster, resulting in a very high response rate. You will start seeing results in just two weeks or less – perfect timing for next month's bills. You only need to send out 20 copies, unlike other programs that may require 200 or more. Ideally, recipients should be those who are already engaged in similar programs online and believe in their effectiveness.

Once again, I encourage you to give this program a try. It is simple, costs a maximum of $5, and the returns will exceed your expectations before others even receive letters. Just gift $5 to one person and relish the returns long before others start to see results! If you already have a PayPal account and do not receive the $5, feel free to make a $5 gift to the person at No. 1 and insert your name at No. 3, moving up the remaining two spots. Follow the easy instructions, and in two weeks, you will find $20,000 in your bank account!

Due to the minimal investment, rapid pace, and high profit potential, this program boasts an exceptionally high response rate. It all begins with a $5 transaction through PayPal!

Follow these straightforward instructions:
Email $5 from your PayPal account to the first name on the list (No.1) with a note requesting to join their mailing list. Only the first person on the list receives your name and $5 gift.

Edit the list by removing the first name, moving the remaining two up, and adding your name at No. 3. Avoid adding your name at the top to earn money quickly, as this will limit the reach of your email. By adding your name at No. 3, more individuals will receive the emails, eventually positioning you at No. 1.

Important: Replace the PayPal referring URL in the email with your own PayPal referring URL. Send out a minimum of 20 copies of this email.

Additionally, send this email and payment via email for a faster response – internet transfer speeds!

Consider this: millions of people browse the internet daily worldwide. Begin with these three individuals - sign up, send $5 to the first person, move the other two names up, and add your email address at No. 3. Use the email address associated with your PayPal account.

There's no further action required.

You will receive a total of $20,000 in $5 bills within two weeks, real money for you to spend as you wish – deposit in your bank account or utilize directly from your PayPal account. It's that effortless!

Would you take a chance and try it out? Even if you make a few thousand, wouldn't that be great?

This program is designed for everyone to send only 20 emails each, but you are not restricted to 20. Send as many as you desire. Each set of 20 emails results in $20,000 or more. If you can email forty, sixty, or more, go ahead! The more effort you invest, the greater the returns. Simply repeat steps 1 to 3 every time you run the program for the benefit of everyone on your list!

If you decide to participate, please send a blank email to the last email address on the list (#3) with 'Thanks, I'll Join' in the subject line. This helps everyone track their progress – you will not be added to any mailing list.

Enjoy the journey to prosperity with us! This endeavor may seem dubious to sceptics, but unless you try it, you'll never know. I was initially hesitant too, but I'm glad I took the chance. I have observed similar programs for years, and this is one of the simplest and quickest ones, offering a no-cost trial with PayPal, no postage, no envelopes, and no photocopies – just a bit of your time and trust!

One additional detail, each time someone signs up under your name through your link, you earn $5 from PayPal. They cover the account opening fee and reward you when referred individuals sign up. Let's all leverage this opportunity to generate a substantial income!
