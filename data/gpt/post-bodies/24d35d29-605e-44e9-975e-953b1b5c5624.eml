Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to seek your assistance with a business matter. I was given your contact information by the commercial attach√© of your country's embassy in South Africa. I believe in your integrity and trustworthiness, which is why I am reaching out to you. My name is Romila Kabila, the second son of the late President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Laurent Desire Kabila, who tragically passed away. During my father's presidency, I held a position as his private security, allowing me access to his personal security vault and some of his savings. Following the recent events, our family has decided to move some of the late President Kabila's savings and assets out of the Democratic Republic of Congo to a safer location. We have arranged to transfer $42 million to a financial and security company in London via a diplomatic courier service. I am seeking your assistance in receiving this amount from the security company in London. Your help is crucial as we are unable to handle this on our own due to certain regulations put in place by my late father to prevent misuse of government funds. If you are interested in assisting us, please respond to my email at [romkabila@presidency.com](mailto:romkabila@presidency.com). Once the funds arrive in London, you will need to clear and transfer the $42 million into your bank account. In appreciation of your support, you will be entitled to a 20% commission, with the remaining 80% going back to the family. I look forward to the possibility of working together to accomplish this task. Thank you and best regards, Romila Kabila.
