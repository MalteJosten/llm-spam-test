Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a confidential opportunity with you. In my role at the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria, we have identified an excess fund of US$21.4 million from past contracts. We are seeking an overseas partner to assist in legally transferring this fund. Your involvement will be compensated, with 30% going to you for your role. Additionally, 10% is allocated for incurred expenses, and 60% for the government officials' importation business. If you are interested, please provide your full details for further action. Kindly confirm receipt of this message. Yours faithfully, Engr. Femi Daniel.
