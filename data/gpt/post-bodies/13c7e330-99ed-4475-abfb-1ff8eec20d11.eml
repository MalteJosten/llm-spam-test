A successful sponsor is a valuable support rather than an instant money-maker. Similarly, a strong product line and a fair compensation plan are essential components but not instant money sources. An established company provides a stable foundation but does not guarantee immediate profits. Some believe success stems from a blend of these factors, yet many emphasize personal growth as the key to prosperity.
