Hello, I am Dr. Steven M Duba, son of Mr. Theo Duba of Zimbabwe. I came across your contact details through the South African Information Exchange in Johannesburg. Due to unfortunate events in Zimbabwe involving President Robert Mugabe's actions against white farmers, my father, a wealthy farmer, was a victim of these oppressive acts.  He managed to conceal a significant sum of money in a box, smuggling it out of Zimbabwe to a private security company in South Africa before he passed away. I am currently in South Africa seeking help to transfer the funds (US$15 million) to a safer location. If you are willing to assist, please contact me at 27-83-713-2696. Your compensation for assisting will be discussed. Thank you.
