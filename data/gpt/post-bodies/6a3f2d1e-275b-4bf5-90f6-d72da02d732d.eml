Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Edward Mulete Jr., and I am reaching out to you with a sensitive matter that requires your assistance. My family has faced challenges due to political unrest in Zimbabwe, leading to the loss of my father, Mr. Steve Mbeki Mulete. Before his passing, he made provisions for us to safeguard our future by placing funds, totaling US$21.5 million, in a secure location.

We are seeking your help to relocate this fund out of Zimbabwe to secure our future. The political situation in our country, particularly the restrictions imposed on financial transactions, has made this task difficult. We are offering you 20% of the total funds as a token of appreciation for your assistance. This transaction is confidential and carries no risk to you or us.

If you are willing to assist us, please contact me via email at Edmulete7@netscape.net for further details and to discuss the way forward. Your cooperation in this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for considering our request.

Warm regards,
Edward Mulete Jr.
