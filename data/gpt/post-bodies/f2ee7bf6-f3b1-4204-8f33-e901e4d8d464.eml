Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding a unique opportunity that may be of interest to you. I work in a government office that has identified an unclaimed fund of US$21.4 million, resulting from past contracts. We are seeking a trustworthy partner to assist with transferring this fund overseas due to restrictions on government officials. In return for your assistance, you will be entitled to 30% of the fund, with an additional 10% set aside for expenses. The remaining 60% will be shared among us, the government officials, as we plan to start a business together. If you are interested, please provide your full details for the necessary paperwork. Kindly acknowledge receipt of this message by replying to this email or femi1855@aol.com. Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated. Best regards, Egnr. Femi Daniel.
