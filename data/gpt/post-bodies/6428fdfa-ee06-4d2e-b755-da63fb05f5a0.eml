Greetings, I am reaching out to you on behalf of the associates of my late father, President LAURENT DESIRE KABILA. Following unfortunate events, we are seeking your support in handling a financial matter. We have identified you through credible sources and believe you can assist us with professionalism and trust. The task involves transferring US $25 million and some diamonds to your bank account from a secure location in Europe and South Africa. The origins of these assets relate to a defense budget allocation that my father, along with his colleague, intended for strategic purposes. Due to certain circumstances, we are compelled to seek external assistance to safeguard these assets. Your involvement in this endeavor is crucial, and your role will be rewarded with 5.5% of the total sum upon successful completion. We prioritize confidentiality throughout this process. If you are willing to collaborate, please provide your contact details for further communication. Thank you for your time and consideration.
