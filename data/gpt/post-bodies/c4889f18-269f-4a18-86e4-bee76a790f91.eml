Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several financial analysts featured XrayMedia during the fiscal year 2001/02. At that time, we identified a substantial opportunity in the advertising industry for the company's innovative direct sourcing technology solutions, and it has since delivered. Despite receiving only $2 million in funding over two years to develop its technology, XrayMedia has significantly expanded its revenue sources by launching a financial services division. This expansion is expected to drive revenues to $3-5 million in fiscal 2003 and to $15-25 million in 2004. The growth is attributed to the savings generated by its direct sourcing model for advertisers and retailers. XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) was established in March 2000 to introduce a live negotiating technology for the advertising sector, improving opportunities for both large and small domestic and international customers. By utilizing proprietary software, the company streamlines orders and identifies opportunities based on user criteria, providing cost savings to both buyers and sellers. The company's 'source to business model' eliminates inefficiencies and access restrictions, offering customers a broad range of advertising choices with live negotiating at minimal expenses. XrayMedia is positioned to increase revenues from $1 million to $25 million in three years with minimal funding, distinguishing itself in the post-September 11th market. Trading on the OTCBB with a market valuation under $10 million, XrayMedia has established relationships with numerous large media buyers, major retailers, and smaller merchants. It has attracted attention from prominent investment bankers and analysts, potentially becoming an acquisition target for major retailers. Recently securing advertising financing orders exceeding $500,000, the company anticipates significant revenue growth from $1 million to $5 million. Profitability is expected to improve notably in the upcoming fiscal year, starting in January 2003.
