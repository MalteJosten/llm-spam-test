Let's consider the following information I wrote:

1) Imagine you sell a $24.95 product or service.
2) Suppose you send email announcements for free to 500,000 people each day.
3) Assume you receive one order for every 2,500 emails.

Based on these statistics, here's what you could earn:
[Day 1]: $4,990
[Week 1]: $34,930
[Month 1]: $139,720

You can see why you receive numerous email advertisements...
=> Marketing through email can be highly profitable!

1) What if you marketed a $99.95 offering?
2) What if you emailed over 30,000,000 individuals monthly?
3) What if you gained one order for every 250 emails?

Just visualize the potential after 30 days!

=> The profitability achievable through email marketing is remarkable!

* According to Forrester Research, an email ad is up to 15 times more likely to result in a sale than a banner ad!
