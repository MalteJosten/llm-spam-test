Dear President/C.E.O., I hope this message finds you well. I have an important business opportunity that I believe you may find interesting. I work as an officer at the United Bank for Africa PLC branch in Ilupeju, Lagos, Nigeria. A situation has arisen involving a deceased foreign account holder who left behind $35 million in our bank. Sadly, none of his relatives have claimed the funds. I am reaching out to you to assist in claiming the money by posing as a next of kin. If you are willing to participate, we can work together to retrieve the funds successfully. In return for your help, you will receive 30% of the total sum. This opportunity is risk-free and could be very beneficial. If you are interested, please let me know, and I will provide you with more details on how we can proceed. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Mabo Loko, Branch Officer, United Bank for Africa PLC, Ilupeju, Lagos, Nigeria.
