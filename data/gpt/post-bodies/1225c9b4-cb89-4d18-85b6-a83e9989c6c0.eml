Dear Friend,

"Serving the Tribes While Sharing the Culture" has been the mission of the American Indian Heritage Foundation for nearly three decades.

AIHF has provided support to various Tribes over the years, assisting with essential needs like food, clothing, and medical supplies. Programs like the Student Eagle Awards inspire Indigenous Youth, and Scholarships for Young Native Women have been instrumental in supporting them.

This important work relies on the generosity of individuals like you who wish to contribute positively. Your support is vital, especially now.

Wishing you beauty in your journey,
