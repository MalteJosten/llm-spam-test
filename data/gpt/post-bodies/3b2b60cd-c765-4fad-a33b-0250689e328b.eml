Dear recipient, Let me introduce myself. I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, the wife of late Nigerian Head of State, General Sanni Abacha. Since my husband's passing, my family has faced challenges with the current government. As a result, my son, Mohammed Abacha, is unjustly detained and forced to confess to false accusations, including the handling of my late husband's entrusted funds. You can verify this information in News watch Magazine (Website: http://www.newswatchngr.com) and This Day Newspaper (Website: http://www.thisdayonline.com). Last year, I placed $40,300,000 with a security company abroad, but due to our situation, I need assistance to transfer it to your country. Your support will be appreciated, and we can discuss a percentage share for you. Contact me via email: mrsabacha_11@mail.com or FAX 234-1-7590893 for more details provided by my son, Mallam Mustafa Abacha. Kindly share your telephone number, fax number, and address for communication. Looking forward to a beneficial partnership. Reach me at Telephone Number 234-80-33357110. For security reasons, reply through FAX 234-1-7590893 instead of email, as it is monitored by all family members.
