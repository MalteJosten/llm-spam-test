Unless your site is prominently listed, customers might not find it. We can move you to a high-ranking position across various search engines.\n\nKey points to remember:\n- Search engines follow specific algorithms for their rankings. Knowledge of these algorithms is crucial for attaining top positions.\n- Websites must be submitted regularly; otherwise, they get pushed down the listing.\n- Keywords, meta tags, and titles used in submissions are significantly important.\n\nJust being on large search engines isn\u2019t enough because of their vast size. Professionally submitting your website can elevate your position, making it easier for customers to find you.\n\nEnsure your website is visible by being listed on these search engines:\nExcite, Altavista, Google, Hotboot, WhatUseek, Lycos, WebCrawler, NorthernLight, DirectHit, AlltheWeb, Pepesearch, Searchit, UK Directory, UK Plus, UK Web, TheBrit Index, Media UK, The UK Web Library, UK Yellow Web, Whatsnew, Demon Site of Sites, LookSmart, UK Cybersearch, and more!\n\nAnd many more!\n\nContact us at [regaltelecom@regal.com](mailto:regaltelecom@regal.com)\n\n------_NextPart_1622483731\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=\"ISO-8859-1\"\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: QUOTED-PRINTABLE\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<title></title>\n</head>\n<body bgColor=\"#80ffff\">\n<div><font face=\"Times New Roman\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"4\">\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Arial Black\" size=\"7\" color=\"#ff1c1c\"><strong>Your Shop Web Site is </strong></font></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><font face=\"Arial Black\" size=\"7\" color=\"#ae0000\"><strong><u>NOT B</u></strong><span style=\"color:#ff1c1c\"><strong>eing SEEN</strong></span></font></p>\n<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"Arial Black\" size=\"7\" color=\"#ff0000\"><font size=\"7\">WHY? </font></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"Arial Black\" size=\"7\" color=\"#ff0000\"><em>NO ONE CAN FIND IT!</em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"Garamond\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"7\"><font face=\"Arial Black\"><font face=\"Arial\"><strong><u>YOUR</u></strong> web site is <strong><u>NOT</u></strong> on many search engines and at the Bottom of their listings and as a result</font></font></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"Garamond\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"7\"><font face=\"Arial Black\"><font color=\"#ff0000\">YOU are LOSING customers who cannot find you!</font></font></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"Garamond\" color=\"#0000ff\" size=\"7\"><font face=\"Arial Black\">Can this be changed? <font color=\"#ff0000\">YES!</font></font><br><font face=\"Arial Black\" color=\"#808000\"><strong>Regal Telecom</strong></font> </font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font face=\"Arial Black\" color=\"#ff0000\"><strong><font size=\"7\"><em>For ONLY \u00a379.97</em></font></strong></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"7\"><strong><font size=\"6\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"><em>We will submit your web site to over 350 of the worlds search engines</em><em>.</em></font></font></strong></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"7\"><strong><font size=\"4\"><font color=\"#000000\"><em>(</em><em>see full list of Search Engines at the end of this document)</em></font></font></strong></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font size=\"7\"><font size=\"6\"><font size=\"7\"><font color=\"#000000 size=\"6\"></font></font></font></font></strong></em></font>&nbsp;</div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font size=\"7\"><font size=\"6\"><font color=\"#0000ff\"><font size=\"7\"><font size=\"6\">We will submit your site with the most effective meta tags </font><font size=\"6\">and keywords.</font></font> </font></font></font></strong></em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font color=\"#ff0000 size=\"4\"><font color=\"#ff0000\"><font size=\"6\">(See our money back guarantee)</font> </font></font></strong></em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font color=\"#ff0000 size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000ff size=\"6\">We know what the search engines are looking for.</font></font></strong></em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font color=\"#ff0000 size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000ff size=\"6\"><font face=\"Arial Black\" color=\"#ff0000>How do we know?</font> We look at the top five web sites in your category and use the same meta tags and key words that they use.</font></font></strong></em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font color=\"#ff0000 size=\"4\"><font color=\"#0000ff size=\"6\"><font size=\"7>If it works for them it will work for you!</font></font></strong></em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font color=\"#ff0000><font size=\"7>So YOUR web site can be<BR></font><span style=\"color:#ff0000;font-size:7pt;font-weight:bold;\">FOUND and SEEN</span></font></strong></em></font></div>\n<div align=\"center\"><font size=\"6\"><em><strong><font color=\"#ff0000><font size=\"7>For Twelve Months!

Appreciate the Three Golden Rules \"Search engines do not pull up the web sites at random they use a specific method of search. Those that know them are the ones at the top, those that do not are buried at the bottom! Your web site must be submitted to the search engines every month otherwise your site gets pushed off (Its a bit like a Ferris wheel, you get on and then after a while you are taken off unless you get another ticket and get back on). Understand the importance of Keywords, Meta tags, and Titles employed when submitting your site to the search engines! Use the right ones and you go up. Get it wrong and you go to the bottom! Some feel that it is enough to be on the large search engines. Wrong! The problem is because of their sheer size most web sites get buried. Having your web site professionally submitted can boost you up the listings of these larger search engines, so you can be found on them. Also many people use the smaller search engines and if your site is professionally submitted your chances of getting to the top are greatly increased. It is essential to be on them!

While we have not met, I am reaching out in the hope of establishing a trustworthy partnership for a discrete and confidential matter.\n\nMy name is BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, and I was the legal advisor to the late General Sani Abacha, the former military ruler of Nigeria, who passed away while in office. Following his death, his family has faced significant challenges and scrutiny from successive governments. His widow is currently restricted from leaving their home state of Kano, while the eldest son remains in detention.\n\nAlthough substantial sums have been recovered from Mrs. Abacha by the current government, a considerable amount of funds valued at USD $50 million remains undisclosed. This money has been securely moved out of the country and is currently held in North America. We are seeking a dependable individual to assist in facilitating the claim of these funds. In return for your assistance, you will receive 25% of the total amount after the necessary formalities with the security company are complete.\n\nPlease be assured that there is no risk involved, as I will be overseeing the process given my close association with the Abacha family. We kindly request that you maintain the confidentiality of this matter. We are also open to further collaborations pending your approach towards this arrangement. I look forward to your prompt response. Thank you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBARRISTER ADEWALE COKER.\n\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork"
