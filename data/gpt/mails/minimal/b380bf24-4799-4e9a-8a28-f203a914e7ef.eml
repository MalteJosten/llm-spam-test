Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. I am Mr. Thema Ordi, Manager of Bills/Exchange at Absa Bank Limited in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Recently, we discovered an unclaimed sum of US$12.5 million in an account that belonged to one of our late foreign customers who tragically passed away with their family in a plane crash in November 1994. Despite our efforts to locate the next-of-kin, no one has come forward to claim the funds.

To prevent the money from being handed over to the government as unclaimed funds, I am reaching out to propose a business arrangement with you. By presenting yourself as a relative of the deceased, we can facilitate the transfer of the funds to your account.

Upon successful completion of the transaction, my colleagues and I intend to share 60% of the total sum, with 30% for you and 10% to cover expenses incurred during the process.

Your prompt response indicating your willingness to participate in this venture would be greatly appreciated. Please maintain utmost confidentiality throughout our communication.

Kind Regards,
Thema Ordi
