Hello, I am contacting you as Barrister Williams Falana, a member of the Nigeria Bar Association. Your information came to me through a reputable source, and I felt inclined to present a business opportunity to you with mutual benefits in mind. A sum of USD48 million was deposited by the late Head of State, General Sani Abacha, in a security company in our country for safekeeping. It was meant for his political campaign. As his family attorney, he shared the relevant documents with me before his passing. We have arranged for this money to be moved to an offshore security company in the form of a consignment. Your role would be to claim this consignment as the rightful beneficiary. This transaction is completely safe and risk-free. Your share in this venture would be 20% for your assistance, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us. To proceed, please provide your full name, address, telephone, and fax numbers for communication purposes. Upon receiving your details, we can finalize this within seven working days. You can contact me at 234-80-33055024 or email me at williamsfalana@caramail.com. Thank you.
