Subject: ANTICAIPTING TO HEARING FROM YOU SOON.

Greetings,   I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your assistance in a business endeavor. I came across your contact information online and felt compelled to connect with you.   My name is Kone Bakar, the son of late Mr. and Mrs. Coulibaly Bakar. My father, a successful cocoa merchant from Ivory Coast, passed away under tragic circumstances. Prior to his demise, he disclosed the existence of a sizable sum of money, $16,500,000, in a local bank. I am looking for a trustworthy individual to help me transfer this money for future investments.   I kindly request the following:   1. Provide a bank account for fund transfer.  2. Act as the overseer of the fund due to my young age.  3. Assist in my relocation after the fund transfer.   In appreciation of your help, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total amount after the successful transfer.   Kindly express your willingness to assist so we can proceed promptly. If possible, please reach out to me via phone before replying.   Thank you for your time and consideration.   Best Regards,   Kone Bakar
