Subject: YOUR ANTICIPATED ASSISTANT IS REQUIRED.

Hello, I am Mr. Ike Ejoh, the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria in Lagos. I have an important and confidential business opportunity that I would like to discuss with you. On June 6, 1999, a foreign oil consultant/contractor named Mr. Barry Kelly made a fixed deposit of $25,000,000.00 in my branch. Unfortunately, Mr. Kelly passed away, and as he didn't leave a will, the funds are unclaimed. I have facilitated the transfer of this fund to a security company in Holland. If you are interested in learning more and potentially benefiting from this opportunity, please reply to me directly at [Email Address]. Thank you.
