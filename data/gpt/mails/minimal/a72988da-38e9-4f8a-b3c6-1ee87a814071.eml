Hello, my name is Abdul Fadi. I am a 65-year-old man. I lost my wife and two children in a car accident six years ago. Currently, I am in Nigeria undergoing medical treatment. Since then, I have been supporting orphans in various orphanages by donating money before I fell ill. I had sent $25 million in several boxes to a security company. The funds are currently held by the company. Unfortunately, my doctors have informed me that I have lung cancer and only a few months to live. Could you kindly assist me in retrieving the boxes from the security company? Once retrieved, you can help me deliver the funds to an orphanage in London or a nearby location. In return for your help, you will receive 15% of the total amount ($25 million), with 5% allocated for any expenses you may incur. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Thank you.
