Dear President/CEO, I am reaching out to you in regards to a potential business opportunity regarding an abandoned sum of US$37,400,000.00 that belonged to a deceased American customer. The funds currently remain unclaimed, and as such, our department is seeking a trustworthy individual to assist in transferring the funds securely. If you are interested, please kindly provide your contact information and banking details for further communication. Your discretion and confidentiality in this matter are highly appreciated. Thank you. Sincerely, Johnson S. Abu
