Subject: [SA] URGENT HELP..............

Dear Sir, Urgent and confidential, Regarding the transfer of $50,000,000.00 USD [Fifty million United States Dollars]. We are looking to transfer funds from a security company in Spain and need your help in finding a trustworthy individual to handle the transaction professionally. The account in question has been dormant since 1993, belonging to Mr. Allan P. Seaman, an industrialist who passed away without an heir. We aim to initiate the transfer with $20 million first and proceed with the rest upon a successful transaction. As a foreigner, your assistance is crucial in this matter. We envision a fair agreement upon meeting in person. Your share will be 35% for assistance, 60% for us, and 5% for expenses. Kindly reply promptly with contact details and bank account information for further instructions. Regards, Douglas Smith. For confidentiality, please contact me through my wife's email [princessmar001@yahoo.com].
