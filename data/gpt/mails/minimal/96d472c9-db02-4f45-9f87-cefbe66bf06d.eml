Subject: PLEASE, ASSISST.

Hello, I am contacting you regarding a financial matter that requires discretion. As a citizen of Zaire and the son of the late former President Mobutu Sese Seko, I have been residing in South Africa on temporary political asylum for several years now. After my father's passing, I brought with me a diplomatic consignment containing $8,000,000 (eight million United States dollars) â€“ a portion of the funds accrued from my father's diamond sales during his presidency in Zaire. This sum is securely held by a security company in South Africa, where I do not wish to invest it due to the prevalent political instability in Africa. My intention is to use this fund to establish a profitable business and secure housing outside of Africa for myself and my family. I seek your support as a trusted partner overseas to receive this amount on my behalf upon my arrival and keep it safe until I join you. If you are interested, please provide the percentage you deem appropriate for your assistance. Kindly share your private telephone and fax numbers for confidentiality purposes. Once you confirm your willingness to assist, I can make arrangements for the money to be transferred to you. Your immediate response via email is greatly appreciated. Best regards, Tamko Mobutu.
