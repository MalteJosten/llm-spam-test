Your Kind Attention,

I have sensitive and urgent information to share with you. However, please note that I came across your email address through a basic online search, and there is no obligation for you to respond. Should you choose to engage, and if the circumstances align, you will be duly compensated. I am currently using a pseudonym and free web-based email accounts for my own security.

Before delving further, I urge you to explore the following websites for context:

I have shared information on the Abacha family's wealth, which is a matter of public knowledge, confirming the transfer of funds by General Sani Abacha out of Nigeria. However, a significant portion of this fortune remains undisclosed or untouched by foreign authorities. The widow of Gen. Sani Abacha, Her Excellency Hajia Abacha, along with her family, is currently under house arrest in Nigeria. My role is to identify a trustworthy individual to assist in transferring a negotiated sum from the concealed millions of dollars. Stricter measures are in place to prevent any disclosure to authorities, as has occurred previously. As a security precaution, I am using an alias at this point.

In essence, I seek an individual or organization capable of providing one or multiple bank accounts for transferring $5,000,000.00 to $10,000,000.00 weekly. These transfers will be conducted in small, regular amounts to avoid raising suspicion. The proper legal procedures and documentation will be followed for these transfers. The right candidate must establish new bank accounts devoid of any legal complications. Individuals with adverse financial backgrounds or legal issues need not respond. A successful candidate will receive 25% of all transfers, subject to strict confidentiality and conditions.

If you are interested in assisting this family and meet our criteria, please respond to the provided email addresses with your contact information. Rest assured, if you do not meet the requirements after a brief evaluation, you will be duly informed. Prior to replying, I encourage you to thoroughly review the provided links for a better understanding. This is a genuine offer, despite the unconventional means of communication.

I anticipate your response.

Warm regards,

Alhaji Abubakar
