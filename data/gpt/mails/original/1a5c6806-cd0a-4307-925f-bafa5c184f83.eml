Dear Sir/Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding an opportunity that requires your confidentiality. I was introduced to you by the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce and Industries. We are a group of officials from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Federal Ministry of Finance, and the Presidency forming the Contract Review Panel appointed by the Federal Government of Nigeria. During our work, we identified an excess sum of US$21.4 million from past contracts. This money is currently in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria and needs to be transferred. Our regulations prevent us from owning foreign accounts, hence the need for an overseas partner. If you agree to assist, you will receive 30% of the funds. The process is based on trust, and the payment will be made via a certified bank draft in your name. If you are interested, please provide your full details for the necessary paperwork. For any queries, please use the following email: femi1855@aol.com. Thank you for your attention. Best regards, Egnr. Femi Daniel.
