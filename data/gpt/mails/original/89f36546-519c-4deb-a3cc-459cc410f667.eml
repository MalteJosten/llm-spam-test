Hello,

I am contacting you as Barrister Williams Falana, a member of the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA). Your contact information was shared with me through the World Business Encyclopaedia. I wish to discuss a business opportunity with you in a confidential manner that could benefit both of us.

A sum of USD48M (Forty-eight Million United States Dollars) was placed in a security company in our country by the late Head of State, General Sani Abacha, for safekeeping. This money is stored in security vaults labeled as personal belongings, and the security company is unaware of the actual contents of the boxes. Originally, this money was intended for his political campaign. As his family attorney, he entrusted me with the necessary documents related to this deposit before his passing.

We have made arrangements with an offshore security company to transfer this money as a consignment through diplomatic channels to their overseas office. At the offshore office, you will need to claim the consignment as its rightful beneficiary. It's essential to note that this business deal is safe and entirely risk-free as it does not involve illicit funds.

If you are interested in pursuing this transaction with me, you will receive 20% of the total amount as your share, 5% for general expenses, and 75% for us to divide.

Kindly provide your full name and address via email for drafting a mutual agreement to govern our collaboration in this transaction. This information will also facilitate the transfer of ownership of the consignment to your name as the legitimate beneficiary.

Additionally, please share your telephone and fax numbers for seamless communication.

Once you confirm your interest by providing the requested details, we can finalize this transaction within seven working days.

I look forward to your prompt response. You can reach me at my cell phone number: 234-80-33055024 or via my alternate email address: williamsfalana@caramail.com.

Best regards,
Barrister Williams Falana (SAN)
