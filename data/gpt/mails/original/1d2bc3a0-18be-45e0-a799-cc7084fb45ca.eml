Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I have an interesting opportunity that I believe you might find valuable. Despite not having had the pleasure of meeting you, I got your contact information from a reliable source at the Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

I work as an officer at the United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) branch in Ilupeju, Lagos, Nigeria.

The proposition is as follows: We have a situation involving a deceased foreign customer, specifically a Turkish national who was a contractor with a government agency. In our branch, he left behind a significant sum of US$35 million, and no next of kin has come forward to claim the funds since his passing four years ago.

Together with two other senior bank officials, we have kept this account undisclosed until now. We are looking for a foreign partner, like yourself, to pose as one of his next of kin and provide us with your account details and other necessary documents that we will guide you on. We will utilize our positions to facilitate the retrieval of the funds within ten working days.

If you are interested, please let me know, and I will provide you with all the details needed to proceed with the arrangement.

In return for your assistance, we are willing to offer you a generous portion of thirty percent (30%) of the total sum once the transaction is successfully completed. The process is secure and has the potential to be highly rewarding.

All communication regarding this matter will be conducted via email.

I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,

MR MABO LOKO
