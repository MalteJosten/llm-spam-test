Hello, I am Mrs. Sese-Seko, the widow of the late President Mobutu Sese-Seko of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am reaching out to you discreetly given my current situation. I, along with my late husband and two sons, relocated to different countries to secure our assets due to political changes in the DRC. I currently have funds worth $18 million stored safely with a security company and I'm seeking your assistance in managing this money discreetly. If you are interested, kindly provide your contact information, and I will introduce you to my son, who will guide you in the process. Your confidentiality in this matter is crucial. Thank you for your understanding. Best regards, Mrs. M. Sese Seko.
