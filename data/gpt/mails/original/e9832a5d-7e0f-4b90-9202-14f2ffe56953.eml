The article discusses the implementation of Production Mini-plants in mobile containers by Science Network. This initiative aims to provide technology and support for the production of Mini-plants in portable containers, offering a range of production systems like bakeries, steel nails, welding electrodes, and more. Science Network is engaging in a Co-investment Program to establish small Assembly plants for manufacturing these Mini-plants, connecting them to the World Trade System for efficient access to resources. The focus is on setting up assembly plants in target regions, utilizing local resources for cost-effectiveness. For further details, refer to the original article by Steven P. Leibacher for The Financial News.
