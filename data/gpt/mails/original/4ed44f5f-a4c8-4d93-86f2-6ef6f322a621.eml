We are happy to announce that domain registration is now available to everyone at affordable prices. You can now register new domain names such as .BIZ or .INFO, in addition to the original .COM and .NET names, for only $14.95. These new domain extensions have been approved by ICANN and have the same rights as the original domain names. The main advantage is that .BIZ and .INFO domain names are now more accessible, making it easier to get a great and memorable domain name for the same price. Check out more information at: [http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/](http://www.domainsforeveryone.com/).
