Hello. Dear Sir, I found your contact during a serious search for a trustworthy international partner. This search led me to reach out to you for help with transferring my funds for investment purposes. My name is Mr. Ibrahim Jallow, the son of the late Sierra Leonean businessman, Mr. Kulu Jallow. Two years ago, my father passed away during an attack on our residence by the Revolutionary United Front Rebels in Makeni, Sierra Leone. With the recent ceasefire and the assistance of the United Nations peacekeeping troops, I seized the opportunity to leave the country with a vital document concerning US$14.5 million deposited by my father in a security company in Dakar, Senegal, under my name. The funds were accrued from diamond exports. I am in search of a reliable individual or foreign firm to invest this money with, as I am the rightful heir to these funds. I am reaching out to you based on your expertise in international commercial investments. For your assistance, I am willing to offer you 15% of the total sum after the successful transfer of the funds. If you are willing to collaborate, please email me your acceptance, and we can discuss the next steps of this transaction. I greatly appreciate your help. Looking forward to your prompt response. Yours faithfully, Mr. Ibrahim Jallow.
