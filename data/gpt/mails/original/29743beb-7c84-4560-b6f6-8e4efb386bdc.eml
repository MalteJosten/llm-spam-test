Dear Sir/Madam, I am contacting you regarding a confidential matter that requires assistance. I am Barrister Adewale Coker, a legal representative from Lagos-Nigeria. I am assisting the family of the late General Sani Abacha, the former military ruler. The family has faced difficulties from successive governments since his passing. Currently, the family's assets are under scrutiny, and we have managed to secure US$50 million in North America. There is an opportunity for you to become a beneficiary of a portion of these funds. Your involvement in this discreet transaction can yield a 25% share of the total amount. This arrangement is safe and risk-free as I am closely involved with the Abacha family. Your confidentiality is crucial, and further cooperation may arise from this initial venture. Please consider this opportunity and respond promptly. Thank you. Kind regards, Barrister Adewale Coker.
