Dear Recipient, I am Mrs. Sese-Seko, the widow of the late President Mobutu Sese-Seko of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am reaching out to you in confidence due to my current circumstances. Following challenges in DRC, my family and I relocated to different countries for safety reasons. Unfortunately, my husband passed away due to illness. To safeguard our assets from government seizure, I converted some funds into a secure format. We have funds amounting to $18 million in a security company coded for confidentiality. I seek your assistance to receive and invest this sum discreetly. If you are willing to help, please provide your contact details for further communication. Your privacy and trust are paramount in this matter. Thank you for your consideration. Best regards, Mrs. M. Sese Seko
