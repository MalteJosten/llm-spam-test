Hello,

I am Johnson S. Abu, the bills and exchange Director at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Central Bank of Nigeria. I am reaching out to seek your assistance in a unique business opportunity within my department. We have come across an abandoned sum of US$37,400,000.00 in the account of a deceased American client named Engr. John Creek (Junior), an oil merchant with the federal government of Nigeria, who tragically passed away with his family in a plane crash.

Since no next of kin has come forward to claim the funds, my colleagues and I propose to transfer the entire amount to your account, with a sharing ratio of 30% for you as the foreign partner and 70% for us. Once the transfer is completed, we plan to use our share to import computer accessories into our country.

If you are interested, please contact me promptly with your details so we can proceed with the necessary approvals before the transfer. Due to the sensitivity of this matter, confidentiality is crucial.

Please provide your Phone and Fax Number.

Thank you,
Johnson S. Abu
