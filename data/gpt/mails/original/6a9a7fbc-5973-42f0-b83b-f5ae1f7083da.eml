Subject: Awiating your fax response.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a confidential opportunity that I believe may be of mutual benefit. A colleague from the Nigeria Export Promotion Council referred me to you following a recent trade exhibition in your country.

I am a director of engineering and projects at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria. Alongside four other colleagues, we have identified approximately Thirty One Million United States Dollars in overdue contract payments that we are looking to transfer to a foreign account. The origin of these funds dates back to the previous government, where officials granted themselves inflated contracts that are now pending payment.

In order to facilitate this transfer, we are seeking a reliable foreign partner or individual with a foreign account. Your role would involve receiving the funds on our behalf. Your assistance will be generously compensated, with 20% for you, 70% for us, and 10% for taxation and expenses.

I understand the sensitivity of this matter and assure you it is a secure and confidential transaction. Your expertise is not a hindrance, and I trust that we can work together to achieve a successful outcome. I eagerly await your response, and upon your interest, I will provide further details on the transaction.

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours faithfully,
Dr. Kataga Bakori
