Dear Sir, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to seek your assistance and guidance for myself and my children. I recently came across your contact details in my late husband's address book and felt compelled to reach out to you. I believe you are a trustworthy individual who can offer support without any form of intimidation or betrayal of trust. My name is Anne Kojo, and I hail from Konobo in the Kerema local district of Sierra Leone. I am the widow of the late Dr. Mundi A. Kojo, who tragically lost his life due to the conflict in Sierra Leone. Before his untimely death, my husband entrusted me and our children, Ibrahim and Amina, with the task of leaving Sierra Leone to ensure our safety amidst the civil unrest. We managed to flee to Togo with some valuables, including a sum of $25 million, which is currently held with a Trust Company in Togo. I seek your assistance in accessing these funds and facilitating their transfer to your country for investment purposes. Your involvement is crucial as we aim to secure a stable future for my children. I am willing to offer a significant reward of 20% of the total sum for your help. For security reasons, I recommend finalizing the arrangements with my son, Ibrahim Kojo. Please reach out to him at ibrahimkojo@caramail.com when you are ready to proceed. Your discretion and confidentiality are appreciated in this matter. Thank you for your understanding and support. Warm regards, Anne Kojo.
