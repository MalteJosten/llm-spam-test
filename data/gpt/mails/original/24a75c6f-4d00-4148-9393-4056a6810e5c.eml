Hello, I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zimmy Mabo, originally from Zimbabwe. In the past, I served as a personal aide to President Robert Mugabe. I made a difficult decision to leave my position and took with me a sum of twenty-five million US dollars ($25,000,000) that was allocated for President Mugabe's re-election campaign under the Zaunpe party. Presently, I have managed to transfer these funds discreetly to a secure facility in the Netherlands.

I am reaching out in search of a reliable individual or company to provide guidance on wise investments and to assist in establishing an account for the funds. Additionally, I am interested in acquiring properties for my family's future residence.

Regarding compensation, I am prepared to offer a generous commission of 25% along with covering 5% of any incurred expenses such as telephone bills, travel expenses, and accommodation.

I intend to invest half of my share of the total sum into a joint venture, preferably in real estate or another profitable business. Rest assured, there is no risk involved for you as the funds are solely under my ownership. Once I receive your consent, I will share further details and the contact information of the security company holding the funds. I believe that partnering with you in this endeavor and future ventures will yield significant success and establish a lasting business relationship.

Best regards, Zimmy Mabo
