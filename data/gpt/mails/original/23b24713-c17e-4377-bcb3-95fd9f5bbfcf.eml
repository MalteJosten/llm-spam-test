Hello,

I am Edward Mulete JR., the son of Mr. Steve Mbeki Mulete from Zimbabwe. I hope this message finds you well. My mother, Mrs. Clara, found your contact through her private search.

Due to the recent events in Zimbabwe, where white farmers have been asked to surrender their farms to the government for redistribution and political gain, my family has faced significant challenges. Sadly, my father was a victim of these circumstances, losing his life and valuable possessions in the process.

Following my father's passing, we received important documents from a local pastor that informed us of a deposit made in a secure facility on our behalf amounting to US$21.5 million. We are seeking assistance to relocate this fund out of Zimbabwe due to our safety concerns.

If you are willing to help, please contact me via email for further details on this confidential transaction. We have devised a plan to carry out the transfer smoothly within two weeks. Your involvement will be compensated with 20% of the total sum.

Kindly respond to Edmulete7@netscape.net if you are interested in assisting us with this matter. Your support will not only benefit us but also offer you an opportunity to partake in a rewarding investment opportunity in the future.

Thank you for considering our request, and may you be blessed abundantly for your kindness.

Warm regards,
Mr. Edward Mulete
