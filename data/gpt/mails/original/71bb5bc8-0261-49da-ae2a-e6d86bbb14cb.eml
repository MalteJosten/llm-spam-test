Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss a potential opportunity that may be of interest to you. I am Barrister Kola Owolabi, representing the interests of Alhaji Ishmaila Ibrahim Gwarzo. Mr. Gwarzo, the former chief security advisor to the late General Sani Abacha, has found himself in a challenging situation following the transition to a new government in Nigeria.

I would like to share a business proposal with you on behalf of my client. Mr. Gwarzo has informed me about funds held in a security company overseas, originating from security allocations during his time in office. Due to unforeseen circumstances, he is unable to access these funds and is seeking a reliable partner to assist with the transfer process.

The total sum in question amounts to USD17.6 million. If you are open to exploring this opportunity further, please contact me via email. I have all the necessary documentation to facilitate this transaction and will provide you with more details upon your response.

Thank you for considering this proposal.

Warm regards,

Barrister Kola Owolabi (JP)
Principal Partner, Owolabi & Associates
