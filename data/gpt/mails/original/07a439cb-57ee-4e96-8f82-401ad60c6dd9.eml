FROM THE DESK OF: Dr. Tom Eke E-Mail: dr_tomeke@spinfinder.com Lagos, Nigeria.  Dear Friend,  I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you regarding a confidential business opportunity that I believe might interest you. This opportunity requires the utmost discretion due to its sensitive nature. Although I understand that initial skepticism is natural in such matters, I assure you that all precautions have been taken to ensure a smooth and risk-free process.  Allow me to introduce myself - I am Dr. Tom Eke, a Director General at the Department of Petroleum Resources (D.P.R) overseeing Contract Awards and Payment Approvals. We have identified you as a trustworthy individual who can assist us in transferring a significant sum of money to a foreign account. This fund originates from an over-inflated contract sum intended for distribution among us as officials.  To proceed, we require your cooperation to facilitate the transfer of $31 million to your account. In recognition of your assistance, you will receive 20% of the total amount, while the remaining sum will be divided among officials. Rest assured, this transaction is entirely legal and devoid of any illicit activities.  Your involvement is crucial, and we request your complete honesty, confidentiality, and trust throughout this process. If you are willing to collaborate, I will provide further details and instructions to ensure a successful transfer within a reasonable timeframe.  Kindly acknowledge receipt of this message at the provided email address. I eagerly await your response to initiate this mutually beneficial endeavor. Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely, Dr. Tom Eke  NB: Please note that this business transaction is legitimate and complies with all legal regulations.
