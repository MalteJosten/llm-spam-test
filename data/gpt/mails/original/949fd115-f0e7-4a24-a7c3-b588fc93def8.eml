Hello, my name is Mr. IKE EJOH. I work as a Bank Manager at Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have an important and confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor, Mr. Barry Kelly, placed a Fixed Deposit of US$25,000,000.00 in my branch. Unfortunately, Mr. Barry Kelly passed away in an automobile accident without naming any next of kin or beneficiary. The funds are currently at risk of reverting to the Nigerian Government if unclaimed. I've initiated the transfer of the funds to a security company in Holland. I require your help to claim and invest the funds. If you are interested, please contact me via email for further details. Your discretion is appreciated. Thank you.
