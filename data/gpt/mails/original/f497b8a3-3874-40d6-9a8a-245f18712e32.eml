Dear Sir, I hope this message finds you well. I have come across an opportunity that I believe we can mutually benefit from. In the past, Nigerian banks transfer unclaimed funds to their treasury, and currently, there is a significant amount belonging to the late Dr. David Fang. As his former account manager, I have the means to facilitate the release of these funds to a designated beneficiary. With your cooperation, we can work together to claim this $14,900,000. Your role would involve acting as the next of kin to Dr. Fang, providing a bank account for the transfer, and sharing your contact information for effective communication. In return for your assistance, you will receive 40% of the total amount, 10% will cover expenses, and the remaining 50% will be shared between us upon my visit to your country. I look forward to a fruitful partnership. Kind regards, Ronard Tony.
