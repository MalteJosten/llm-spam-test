In the Spring of 1979, I was just a tall, goofy kid in middle school with buck-teeth and freckles. Each day in the cafeteria, I walked around tables... taking other kids' lunch money. No, I didn't confront them with a gun or a knife; I simply made them a small offer. 'Let me borrow two dollars today,' I said, 'and I'll give you five dollars back next week.' The deal was too enticing, and soon, I had a string of kids eagerly giving me their lunch money. When the promised week arrived and I couldn't return the cash, I assured them of even more returns the following week if they allowed me to extend their investment. As time passed, and high school commenced with its distractions of girls, homework, parties, and sports, the eighth-grade lunch money lenders moved on, forgetting about their previous year's losses. I made a tidy sum for a middle schooler and avoided any repercussions. Hidden within this narrative are two vital stock market lessons: greed is the primary adversary and never blindly trust investment advisors. The key is to cash out when ahead and not fall into the trap of never selling, as advocated by traditional advisors. Youth is the prime time to reap financial benefits, making volatility an ally and stability an enemy when seeking quick profits in day trading. The essence lies in day trading, a practice I excelled at, generating significant financial gains. The inclination towards day trading signifies a vehicle for swift wealth accumulation.
