Dear Sir, I hope this message finds you well. I'm Captain John Okele, the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila. During my time in the Democratic Republic of Congo, I assisted President Kabila with safeguarding US$35 million. I'm currently residing in Leicester, United Kingdom, due to safety concerns from the government. I'm seeking your assistance to invest these funds discreetly before they are discovered by the authorities. Your involvement will be rewarded with 45% of the funds, and I have allocated 5% for any incurred expenses. The remainder will be used for setting up investments for my family. I am open to your suggestions and recommendations for a long-term profitable investment plan. Please provide your contact details for direct communication. Thank you for considering my request.
You can reach me at johnokele2@hotmail.com or through my cousin's phone number provided in the previous communication for confidentiality.
