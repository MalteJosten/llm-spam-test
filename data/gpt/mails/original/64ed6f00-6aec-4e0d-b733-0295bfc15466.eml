Hello,

I am reaching out to you seeking your assistance in a financial matter. I am the eldest son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the former President of the Congo Republic. Currently, I am in Nigeria as a political refugee. I came across your contact information online while looking for a trustworthy individual to collaborate with on a business opportunity.

This venture is mutually beneficial and involves a substantial sum of money, specifically 50 million US dollars. This sum is my inheritance from my father, which I secured in a security company overseas during a period of political unrest in my country. With the situation now stabilized, I am in need of a reliable person, such as yourself, to help me access and invest this inheritance anonymously.

In order to proceed with this opportunity, I will provide you with all necessary documents to authorize your access to the funds. To ensure confidentiality, I request the following from you:

1. A signed commitment to maintain the confidentiality of this transaction.
2. Confirmation of your capability to manage this endeavor.
3. Your international identity or driver's license number for identification purposes.
4. Your contact telephone and fax numbers for communication.
5. Your complete permanent address.

Once I receive the requested information, I will share the details of the security company holding the funds and arrange for them to contact you directly. Additionally, I will issue you a Letter of Authority to facilitate the release of the funds on my behalf.

Please respond promptly so that we can move forward together.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,

Moshood Seko Mobutu
