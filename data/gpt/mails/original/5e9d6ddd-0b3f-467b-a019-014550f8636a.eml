Our Latest Find: XRMD - XrayMedia has been featured in various investment reports during the fiscal year 2001/02. The company has shown promise in the advertising industry due to its innovative direct sourcing technology solutions. With a modest $2 million raised over two years, XrayMedia has expanded revenue sources by introducing a financial services division. This expansion is expected to boost revenues to $3-5 million in fiscal 2003 and to $15-25 million in 2004. The company's unique direct sourcing model offers advertisers and retailers cost savings of up to 70% by streamlining processes, reducing costs, and providing free mass sourcing opportunities through secure real-time negotiation technology on the web.

How does XrayMedia achieve this?

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) was established in March 2000 to develop a live negotiating technology for the advertising sector. With proprietary software, it offers a sophisticated platform that accelerates orders and identifies opportunities based on user criteria, benefiting both advertisers and ad sellers.

Their 'source to business model' eliminates sourcing barriers, providing customers with a wide range of advertising options and live negotiation at a low cost, resulting in significant savings.

Unlike many loss-making tech companies, XrayMedia's projection of revenue growth from $1 to $25 million in three years with minimal funding is impressive. Positioned as one of the top-performing sectors post-September 11th, XrayMedia is poised to surpass its 52-week high of $0.19 soon.
