This is an innovative mailing software called 'BonFire', designed for sending bulk emails conveniently and securely. It ensures anonymous delivery without revealing your IP address. The software is user-friendly, allowing you to easily send emails after setting up your message and recipient list. BonFire utilizes proxy routing for true anonymity, making it unnecessary to search for relays or pay for open servers. It operates at high speeds and is not affected by port 25 blocking. The pricing involves purchasing email credits in blocks, with various packages available at competitive prices. Each purchase includes a free bulletproof mailbox. Performance is optimized for various connection types, and the choice of email lists and message size can impact delivery speed.
