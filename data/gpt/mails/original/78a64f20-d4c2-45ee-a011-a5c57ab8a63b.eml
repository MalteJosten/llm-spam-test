Dear Sir, I hope this message finds you well. I am Captain JOHN OKELE, the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila, the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Currently, I am residing in Leicester City, United Kingdom, with my family, due to safety concerns. I am reaching out to seek your assistance with a financial matter involving funds hidden during the war in my country. I would appreciate your help in investing these funds before they come to the attention of the present Government to secure them. In return for your support, I am willing to offer you 45% of the fund as compensation, with an additional 5% to cover any expenses incurred during the transaction. The remaining amount will be used to establish an investment account for my family. Your input on long-term investment options is valuable, and I look forward to hearing your suggestions. Please provide me with your current contact details for further communication. You can reach me directly via email at johnokele2@hotmail.com. Thank you for your consideration. Yours faithfully, Capt. JOHN OKELE.
