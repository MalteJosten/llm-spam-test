Dear Sir or Madam, I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to you with a sensitive matter that requires your confidentiality. We have come across an inheritance matter that needs to be resolved promptly. Let me introduce myself properly. I am the Manager Bills and Exchange of Foreign Remittance Department at Union Bank of Nigeria. We recently discovered an unclaimed sum of US$7.5 million in the account of a deceased foreign customer. As efforts to find the rightful heir have been unsuccessful, we are seeking a trusted individual to assist us in claiming this inheritance. By partnering with us, you will receive 20% of the total amount as a reward. If you are willing to assist, please provide your banking details, private telephone, and fax numbers. Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. Thank you for your consideration. Yours sincerely, Dr. Markus Phillips.
