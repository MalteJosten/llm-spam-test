I am writing to you concerning a matter that requires confidentiality and trust. I am BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER, the family lawyer of the late General Sani Abacha, a former military ruler of Nigeria. Since General Abacha's passing, his family has faced challenges from subsequent governments. Currently, his wife is under a form of house arrest, and his son is in detention. A significant sum of money, approximately US$50 million, has been moved out of Nigeria for safekeeping. If you are interested, we can designate you as the beneficiary of these funds, and upon clearance, you will receive 25% of the total amount. This project carries no risk, and I assure you of my involvement as a trusted confidant of General Abacha. Kindly treat this communication with utmost discretion. Your prompt response is awaited. Thank you. Yours faithfully, BARRISTER ADEWALE COKER
