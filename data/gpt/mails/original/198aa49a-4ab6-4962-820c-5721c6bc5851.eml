Hello,

We wanted to inform you about the new .NAME domain extension that is now available to the public. This unique domain is designed for individuals like yourself and follows the format FirstName.LastName.NAME. For instance, if your name is Monica Smith, you could secure a domain such as monica.smith.name. Experts anticipate that personalized domain names will become global identifiers, similar to phone numbers.

For a limited time, you can pre-register your personalized .NAME domain for just $10 (plus applicable registry fees) at: [http://www.namesforeveryone.com](http://www.namesforeveryone.com)
