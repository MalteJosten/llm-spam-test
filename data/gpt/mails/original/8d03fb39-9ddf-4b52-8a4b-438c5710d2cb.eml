Good day, I am reaching out on behalf of my colleagues with a proposition that I believe could be of mutual benefit. I hope you would consider assisting us in a confidential matter. We are part of the Department of Minerals and Energy, where I serve as the Director of Audit and Project Implementation. Alongside two other officials, we have come across an overdue payment in US funds. This sum is a surplus from a contract executed by a foreign firm for our Department, leading to an over-invoiced amount of US$29,200,000. Despite the original contractor being paid in full, this excess remains unclaimed. The current administration is keen on settling all debts to foreign parties, thus prompting us to seek your cooperation in this matter. As we are restricted from holding foreign accounts, we need someone to act as the beneficiary for the unclaimed funds. Upon your approval, we would arrange for changes in beneficiary information to reflect your involvement legitimately. Your involvement would be compensated with US$7.3 million (25%), while my colleagues and I would receive US$18.98 million (65%), and the remaining US$2.92 million (10%) allocated for taxes and other expenses. This opportunity is secure and lawful, requiring only your discretion. Your field of expertise or company's line of work is not a barrier, as the necessary arrangements can be made to suit your situation. We trust you will uphold confidentiality and handle this matter prudently. Kindly contact me via phone at 27-83-750 9598 or fax at 27-73-219 9975 for further discussions upon accepting this proposal. May you be blessed as you consider our request. Regards, Ayanda Maredi.
