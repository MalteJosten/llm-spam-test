Dear Sir, I received your contact information from a military acquaintance I trained with in your country. My name is Captain John Okele, the former Commander of the Security Guards for the late President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa. I am currently residing in Leicester City, United Kingdom with my wife and child as we faced threats from the current government, accusing me of knowledge regarding the demise of the late President. During the war in my country, I assisted President Laurent Kabila in safeguarding US$35 million in a security company under the guise of personal effects. The company is unaware of the contents of the boxes. I am seeking your assistance in investing these funds discreetly before the current government discovers them. I propose a partnership where you will receive 45% of the funds as compensation, and 5% will be set aside for any incurred expenses. The remaining amount will be utilized to open an account for my family's future investments with your guidance. I am interested in a sustainable long-term investment plan with your involvement. Your input, terms, and ideas are essential for this endeavor. I eagerly await your swift response. Please provide your current email address, private telephone, and fax numbers for direct communication. Feel free to reach me through the provided contact details for confidentiality. Yours Faithfully, Capt John Okele Email: johnokele2@hotmail.com Private Email: johnokele@london.com
