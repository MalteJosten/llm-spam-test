Hello,

It's been a while since we last met, as I have been busy spending time with my girlfriend.
It's time to move on.
Alex and I are no longer together. I am sharing this with you to give you a better understanding of her true personality.
Out of frustration, I created a personal website where you can learn more: [http://alexandra.hobby.privatseite.to](http://alexandra.hobby.privatseite.to)

What do you think?

Best regards,
Peter
