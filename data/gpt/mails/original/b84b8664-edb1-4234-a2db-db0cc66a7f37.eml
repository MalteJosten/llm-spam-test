Dear friend, I am Mrs. Sese-seko, the widow of the late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am reaching out to you with a confidential matter concerning my current situation. Following the challenging circumstances, I relocated with my family to different countries to ensure our safety. Currently, I have secured a substantial amount of funds for safekeeping and investment purposes. I am looking for a trustworthy individual to assist us in managing this fund discreetly. Should you be interested, kindly provide your contact information, and I will introduce you to my son who will provide further details and discuss potential remuneration for your support. Your discretion in handling this matter is paramount. Please acknowledge receipt of this message. Warm regards, Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.
