Hello, I hope you are well. I reached out to you as I received your contact information from the Ivoirian Chamber of Commerce and felt drawn to your reputable character. After seeking guidance, I believe you are a trustworthy and honest individual. I have a personal matter to discuss that I believe can be mutually beneficial for us. I am Martin Francis, a citizen of Cote d'Ivoire. My late father, the former financial controller of CITELCOM, passed away during the political turmoil. Upon his passing, he entrusted me with the details of a significant sum he placed in a local bank for safekeeping. This amount, totaling US$16,500,000.00, originated from an over-invoiced contract and is earmarked for investment. I require your cooperation to facilitate the transfer of these funds to your account for a business endeavor, as per my father's wishes. If you are interested, please provide your contact information and banking details for a smooth transfer process. Additionally, I seek your assistance in my educational pursuits and future ventures once the funds reach your account. I am prepared to offer you 20% of the total sum as a token of appreciation for your support. Your prompt response is highly appreciated to expedite this transaction securely. Thank you for your consideration. Best regards, Martin Francis.
