This document contains multiple parts.

In this document, we showcase Backup CDs, also referred to as Duplicate CDs. These Backup CDs are duplications of Software.

For instance, if you were to purchase Windows XP Pro from a store for around $299, you would receive the Serial Key, the CD, the Packaging, and the Manual. When acquiring it from us, you will only receive the Windows XP CD and the Serial Number for just $19.99. The functionality remains the same; the only difference is the absence of the manual and the colorful packaging, which are not particularly useful.

Features:
- includes over 400 applications
- contains over 1500 games
- prompt responses within a few hours
- latest releases
- offers the best price on the web
- widest selection of CDs available online
- worldwide shipping
- secure credit card processing through our authorized online retailer. Your information is securely transmitted and encrypted (128-bit).

No need to be concerned about the security of your credit card details.
