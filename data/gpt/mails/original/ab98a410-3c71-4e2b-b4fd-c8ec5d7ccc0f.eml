The new domain names are finally available to the general public after the generic public auction has ended. Not only you can register one of them easily, but the general public at the CMO and NET names form just $14.95. These brand new domain names are just $14.95 each if the specifics are correct, rather than the usual $25. The brand new domain extension is one of the coolest and .COOL and .INFO domain names. These options are key for representation and they can cover panel topics. Visit: [link]
