Hello,

I am contacting you in the hope of a possible collaboration that could benefit both of us. My name is Victor Sankoh, the son of Mr. Foday Sankoh, who was recently apprehended by the ECOMOG Peacekeeping Force in Sierra Leone.

Prior to his arrest, my father entrusted me with a matter of great importance. He instructed me to retrieve an iron box stored in an underground safe, which contains USD$22 million in cash. This money was acquired from the sale of gold and diamonds and was intended for our family's future investments.

Upon verifying the box's deposit with a security company in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, I have been granted political refugee status in the same country.

My father's wish is for a trustworthy individual like yourself to assist in transferring these funds out of Cote d'Ivoire for investment purposes. To proceed, I would need the following:

1. A secure bank account in your country or a nearby jurisdiction with favorable taxation.

2. Help in obtaining the necessary travel documents once the transfer is completed.

3. Guidance on potential profitable business opportunities in your region where a portion of the funds can be invested without requiring advanced technical knowledge.

Maintaining confidentiality is crucial to me, and I trust that you will handle this transaction discreetly. In return for your assistance, I am prepared to offer you a 12% commission on the total sum post-transaction.

I anticipate your prompt response. Thank you and may you be blessed.

Victor Sankoh
