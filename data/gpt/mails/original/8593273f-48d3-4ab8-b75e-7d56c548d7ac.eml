Hello, I am Barrister Williams Falana, a member of the Nigeria Bar Association. Your contact came through the World Business Encyclopaedia. I would like to share a business opportunity with you confidentially for our mutual benefit. The late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) deposited USD48M in a security company here, labeling it as personal belongings. This money was intended for his political campaign. As his family attorney, I have the necessary documents related to this deposit. We have arranged for the funds to be moved to an offshore Security Company through diplomatic means. Your role would be to claim the consignment as the legitimate beneficiary. This transaction is safe and risk-free, not involving illegal funds. If you are interested, you will receive 20% of the total, with 5% covering expenses and the rest for us to share. Please provide your full name, address, telephone, and fax numbers by email. Once confirmed, the process can be completed within seven working days. I look forward to hearing from you. You can contact me at 234-80-33055024 or williamsfalana@caramail.com. Thank you, Barrister Williams Falana.
