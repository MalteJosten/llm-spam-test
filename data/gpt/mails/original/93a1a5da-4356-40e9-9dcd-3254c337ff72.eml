Hello ilug@linux.ie community,

Life Partners are specialists in evaluating life insurance policies, offering individuals the opportunity to access their life insurance funds sooner rather than later. We assist individuals in unlocking cash from their underutilized assets.

People aged 65 or above, facing changes in health, financial circumstances, or estate planning needs, often benefit from our services. In some cases, financial advisors recommend cancelling life insurance policies to invest in immediate-return options. We advise against canceling your policy as it could have immediate value for you.

Why do individuals consider selling their policies?

The motives behind individuals choosing to sell their life insurance policies are diverse and unique. Some common reasons include:

- Settling debts
- Funding long-term care insurance
- Avoiding expensive premiums
- Seizing other financial opportunities
- Making charitable donations
- Supporting family members
