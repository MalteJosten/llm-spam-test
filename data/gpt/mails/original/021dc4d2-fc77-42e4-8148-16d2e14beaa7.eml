Dear President/C.E.O, I hope this message finds you well. I recently came across your contact details through a mutual acquaintance at the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (N.E.P.C.). I am reaching out to discuss a potential business opportunity that requires confidentiality and discretion. As a director at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria, I, along with a few trusted colleagues, have access to overdue contract payments amounting to Thirty One Million United States Dollars. We are seeking a trustworthy foreign partner to assist in transferring these funds to a foreign account. The funds originate from over-invoiced contracts awarded by the previous government, and we need external assistance to facilitate the transfer. Our proposal involves using your company's account or an offshore bank account to receive the funds. In return for your collaboration, you will receive a significant share of the sum as compensation. The entire process is secure and hinges on maintaining strict confidentiality. Your expertise is not a barrier to participation. I trust in your discretion and look forward to your response. If you are interested, please reply via fax at 234 1 7591666. Thank you for considering this opportunity. Sincerely, Dr. Kataga Bakori
