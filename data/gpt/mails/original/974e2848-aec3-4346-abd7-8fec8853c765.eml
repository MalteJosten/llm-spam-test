Hello, I am Dr. James Alabi, the chairman of a committee appointed by the Nigerian government to oversee contract awards.  I discovered your profile during a search for someone trustworthy to handle a confidential financial matter. This involves transferring a significant sum of money to a foreign account. 

There were some contracts in the oil industry, and the original values were inflated, resulting in excess funds of US$12,320,000.00. This amount is now available for transfer since the companies involved have been paid in full. 

My colleagues and I are seeking to transfer this sum to your account for distribution, as civil servants like us cannot have foreign accounts. We are offering you 20% of the sum for your assistance, and 10% will cover any related expenses. We have made all the necessary arrangements at the highest levels for the swift transfer of the funds. This process will be conducted transparently and legally, ensuring your safety and security throughout. 

It is crucial to keep this matter confidential for both our reputations. If you are interested, please reply to this email, and we can provide you with further details. Rest assured, this proposal is entirely risk-free as we have meticulously planned it. Your discretion is appreciated, given our current government roles. 

Your prompt response is much appreciated as we are eager to include this transfer in the upcoming financial schedule. Thank you and God bless. Dr. James Alabi
