I have received messages expressing concern about the content of the Banned CD. Although some may find it controversial, I believe in providing access to rare information. This is your final opportunity to obtain the Banned CD. This CD offers tools to research individuals online quickly, reconnect with old acquaintances, explore options for novelty diplomas, or even learn techniques for creating a new identity. Despite legal threats, I stand by your right to access this information. The authorities are not pleased with my continued distribution of this CD, which allows you unique freedoms.
