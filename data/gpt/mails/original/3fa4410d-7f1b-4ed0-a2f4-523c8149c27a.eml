Dear recipient, I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to seek your assistance in a financial matter of mutual benefit. A group of us, working for the Government of Nigeria, has identified a sum of money that we would like to transfer abroad. This transfer requires a trusted overseas partner, and we believe you could be the right fit. The total amount to be transferred is $25,500,000. We propose a fair distribution of the funds: 20% for you, 70% for us, and 10% to cover expenses. The process is safe, and we aim to complete it within 14 banking days. To proceed, we need your bank and company details for the transfer. Once we receive this information, we can move forward discreetly. Your cooperation and confidentiality are crucial. Feel free to contact me directly for further details and clarification. Best regards, Dr. Ben Kokori.
