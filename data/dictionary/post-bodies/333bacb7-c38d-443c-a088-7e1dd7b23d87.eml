<B>Performance:</B><BR>
The main premise behind BonFire is anonymity to hide your IP
connection.<BR>
This has been achieved without any sacrifice in email delivery speed.<BR>
Best results are on Cable, ADSL, DSL, T1, or a T3 connection,<BR>  
but a dialup connection will work just fine.<P>
<FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Xerox Sans Serif Wide" COLOR="Navy">
The type of email lists you use may also affect the software's
performance.<BR>
Single domain lists will mail faster than a mixed domain email list.<BR> 
A smaller message puts less strain on the mail servers,<BR>
therefore, smaller messages mean faster delivery.<BR>
A small text or html message is all you need,<BR>
to get your customers attention.<P></FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Xerox Sans Serif Wide" COLOR="Navy">
<B>An eye catching subject line is also very important.</B><BR>
BonFire will send either html or text messages.<BR>
You can also control the BCC count.<P></FONT>
<FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Xerox Sans Serif Wide" COLOR="Navy">
Just check a few boxes and send yourself some messages as a test..<BR>
You'll see for yourself the great value of the BonFire mailer.</FONT><P>
