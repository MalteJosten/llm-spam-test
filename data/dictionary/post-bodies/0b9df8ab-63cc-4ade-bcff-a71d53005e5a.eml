.BIZ and .INFO Available Here

Dear sir/madam,

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers [ICANN] has recently approved the addition of new extensions to the internet domain space. The new domain names will offer much-needed competition in the domain market. Consumers will be able to choose from the following new extensions: .biz, .info, and .name

The new top-level domain names are now available to the general public at the following address: http://www.interniconline.com. Priced at only $24.95, the best names are expected to be snapped up quickly so don't hesitate.

Sincerely,

Internic Online
