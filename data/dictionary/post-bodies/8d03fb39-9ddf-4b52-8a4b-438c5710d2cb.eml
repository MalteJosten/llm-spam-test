MR. AYANDA MAREDI
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA.


Good morning,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my colleagues.
I venture to write to you perhaps you will see it fit to assist my
colleagues and I in all honesty as we attempt to seek your assistance.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution
of a deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a Director
of Audit and Project implementation, with the co-operation of two other top officials, we
have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced to the
amount of US$29,200,000.00 (Twenty-Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand US Dollars).
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed,
so as to maintain good relations with foreign governments and non-governmental
agencies, we included our bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front as the
beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts.
Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be US$7.3m (25%) while my colleagues and I receive
US$18.98m (65%) and the balance of US$2.92m (10%) for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.

This business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality.
It does notmatter whether You/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of
powers will be secured in favour of You/your Company. Also, your specialization is not a
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you
and hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by telephone on 27-83-750 9598 or fax 27-73-219 9975 for
further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.

May God's blessings be with you even as you reply.

Regards,


MR. AYANDA MAREDI
