Hello:

Are you satisfied with your ISP? Do you have 5 email addresses for you and your family? Do you have 5 MB of personal webspace? How truly unlimited is your access time?

Our internet service provides you with all of that at a low monthly fee of just $14.95. You get 5 email addresses, 5MB of personal webspace and 350 hours of access time per month (virtually unlimited). That is more than most people will use, do the math.

We have local numbers for many areas.
For further information please email me at codjig@canada.com and place "Request Information in the subject line. 
If you do not wish any more mailings please send a blank email to codjig@canada.com.
Regards,
Steve Murphy
