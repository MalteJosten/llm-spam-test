Subject: [SA] EM1- Aren't we accorded equal opportunity already?


	Aren't Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal 
opportunity already?  Unfortunately, no.  APAs are not accorded 
equal opportunity in workplaces presently.  

	Equal opportunity means: "For every man, woman and 
child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability 
will take them."  Statistics, mostly gathered by government 
studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all 
other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, 
corporate world, the federal government.  There seems to exist 
an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of 
their potentials  --  A Glass Ceiling.

	Let's look at a concrete case.  A lot of our best people are 
employed in universities.  Their average performance has been 
outstanding.  What's their chance of rising to the top?  

	University administrators are recruited almost exclusively 
from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in 
universities.  Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + 
professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the 
opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races.  
Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21.  That is, 
for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black 
administrators.  The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white 
(non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15.  However, it is 
only 0.06 for Asian American.  Get on the Web and check it out 
for yourself!  Source:  Dept. of Education - <www.ed.gov/NCES/ 
pubs/96323.html>, Table B-1f.

	The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly 
"enlightened" academic world.  The situation in the corporate 
world, state and federal governments is worse.  

	In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two 
major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and 
help make our beloved nation "a more perfect Union."   There has 
already been progress on account of that strategy.  Behold how the 
glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing
significantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in 
the 2000 election.

80-20 is a national, nonpartisan, Political Action Committee 
dedicated to winning equal opportunity and justice for all 
Asian Pacific Americans through a SWING bloc vote, ideally 
directing 80% of our community's votes and money to the 
presidential candidate endorsed by the 80-20, who better 
represents the interests of all APAs.  Hence, the name "80-20" was 
created.
