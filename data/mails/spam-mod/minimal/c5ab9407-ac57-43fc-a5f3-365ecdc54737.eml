Subject: adv: Put your resume back to work

Dear Candidate,

We recently came across a posting of your resume on the Internet.   After our 
research, we determined that it was not posted on over 45 other top job sites. 
The impact to you is that over 83% of the employers and recruiters looking to 
hire candidates with your skills are not reading your resume.  

Is your resume taking the day off?  
While most people post their resumes on the top three job sites, such as Monster, 
HotJobs, and CareerBuilder, there are many other specialized job sites that employers 
and recruiters use to find candidates.  

When those specialized job sites are combined with the top three job sites, your 
resume is read by nearly 100% of the employers and recruiters who are looking 
to hire or place candidates with your skills.
