Dear wireless colleagues:

By the end of 2002, China will have over 200 MLN mobile users. From late
of 2003, China will issue 3G licenses and full 3G services will be
available in 2005. Currently, there is still over 5 MLN new mobile users
coming every month, and the mobile revenue is increasing over 25% every
year.

China is so far the world's largest wireless market, and the most
potential business partner in the coming several years. To get involved
in this huge business, 2002 China Wireless Congress is the best platform
which focuses on the following issues:

1. The New Business Models of China's Mobile Communications
2. Infrastructure of Nationwide Wireless Access Systems
3. Convergence of Wireless Local Access and Mobile Networks
4. Evolution of 2G networks to 2.5G and 3G networks
5. Emerging R&D on 4G Mobile and 4G Mobile Forum

7. New Spectrum Management and Sharing Policies
