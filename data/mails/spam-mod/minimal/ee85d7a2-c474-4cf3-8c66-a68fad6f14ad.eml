  <font size="2">Since it may have been awhile since you visited us
at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mailpound.com">www.mailpound.com</a>&nbsp;I
  wanted to update you on what is happening. When we launched the MailPound
  almost two years ago, our focus was on saving &quot;Time, Toner and
  Trees&quot;&nbsp;by providing an alternative for&nbsp;organizing the huge
  number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. Our most popular
  feature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes.</font>

<div>

  <font size="2">But that has changed.</font>

  <font size="2">Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been
  striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional
  commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock
market, has
  had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know
that we
  will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have
gotten a
  tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated
into
  the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers.</font>
</div>
<div>
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div>
  <font size="2">Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for
searching supplier
  Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create
  sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier
  supported and FREE to travel agents.
